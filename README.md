Hybrid-bacterial-genomes
My set of scripts created to prepare new genome assemblies of hybrid bacterial strains:
1.) reference adjustment (only point mutation) 
See the script "Hybrid genome adjustment"
2.) reference annotation (only point mutation) 
3.) advance reference adjustment (point mutations and indels) 
4.) advance reference annotation (point mutations and indels)
