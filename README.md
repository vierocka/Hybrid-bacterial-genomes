Hybrid-bacterial-genomes
My set of scripts created to prepare new genome assemblies of hybrid bacterial strains:
1.) reference adjustment (only point mutation) 
See the script "Hybrid genome assembly"
2.) advance reference adjustment (point mutations and indels) 
3.) advance reference annotation (point mutations and indels)
